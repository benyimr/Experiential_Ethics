# Experiential Ethics (2024) — Slide Decks

This repository contains the slide decks I created for MIT’s [Experiential Ethics](https://elo.mit.edu/experiential-ethics/) program—a discussion-based summer course that invites students to reflect on the moral, social, and political dimensions of their personal, academic, and professional experiences. 

Being part of Experiential Ethics has been one of my most rewarding experiences at MIT. This repository includes only the materials I authored. The EE teaching team has also developed excellent pedagogical resources—including active learning guides and lesson plans—that showcase how innovative and thoughtful the program truly is. If you ever have the chance to join the program—as a student or a teaching fellow—I strongly recommend it!
